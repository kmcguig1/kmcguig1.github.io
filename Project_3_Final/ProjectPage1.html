                <h1>THE SHIRT 2017</h1>
                <h2>The Shirt Project Notre Dame</h2>
                <p>The Shirt Project began in 1990 as a student-led initiative to support the Notre Dame student body and to unify the stadium. For the past 28 years, The Shirt project has continued, selling 2.5 million shirts and raising $10 million for student clubs and organizations, The Shirt Charity Fund, and The Student Enrichment and Opportunity Funds. The Shirt is the top-selling single collegiate apparel item in the United States, and we sold 148,000 units during the 2017 season.</p>

                <p>The Shirt 2017 celebrates the tradition of Notre Dame football while looking forward to the new beginnings of the season ahead. The true navy was a return to a classic Notre Dame color that The Shirt had not seen since 2012. The central theme of the design is the beginning of a Notre Dame football game, capturing the excitement of the crowd and the chills every fan experiences when “Here Come the Irish” begins to play in the stadium. The players walking out to the coin toss and the cheerleaders running with the “Irish” flags symbolize the energy of the start of the game and serve to unite players, students, and fans. Both the front and back designs feature views of the new additions to the stadium, giving a glimpse of the future of football in Notre Dame stadium.</p>
